            <h1>OUR MISSION</h1>
            <p>
                New York Language Centerâ€™s mission is twofold: to provide high quality, affordable English classes to international students in a supportive, friendly atmosphere where students come first, whether their goal is academic, professional or personal self improvement, and expose them to American culture. At the same time, we are committed to providing immigrant New Yorkers with ESL classes that accommodate their needs and prepare them to be part of the society where they live, work and educate their children. The curriculum at New York Language Center is designed to support this mission by providing students with the necessary language tools to help them achieve their goals. New York Language Center is committed to excellence and service at the highest degree
